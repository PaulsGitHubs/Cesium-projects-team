# Intro
The Cesium Team Project brings together cutting-edge technology to visualize 3D models, simulate sensors, and process real-time data. By leveraging Cesium's 3D mapping capabilities, we create dynamic, interactive applications for a range of industries, from IoT integration to advanced sensor simulations. Join us in revolutionizing how we interact with and understand spatial data!

## 📍 Real-Time Object Placement on 3D Map

Watch as users interact with the map by adding and manipulating 3D models in real time! This demo shows the seamless placement of objects, enabling real-time visualization and interaction.

This is just a glimpse of how objects like buildings, cars, or sensors can be integrated into your 3D world.

## Overview
This repository contains our team's contributions to the **Cesium Team Project**, including application demonstrations, object files, videos, and source code. The project aims to merge and organize all work into a structured repository for better collaboration, version control, and open-source sharing.
